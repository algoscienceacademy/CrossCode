# YCode

[![Build YCode](https://github.com/nab138/YCode/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nab138/YCode/actions/workflows/build.yml)

iOS Development IDE for linux and windows, built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

Coming soon...

## Installation

YCode is currently in development and not recommended for use. However, if you want to try it out, your feedback would be greatly appreciated!

You can download the latest build from [actions](https://github.com/nab138/YCode/actions/workflows/build.yml).

## How it works

- [Theos](https://theos.dev/) is used to build the project into an IPA.
- [apple-private-apis](https://github.com/SideStore/apple-private-apis) is used to login to the Apple Account. Heavy additions have been made to support actually accessing the Developer APIs
- [ZSign](https://github.com/zhlynn/zsign) is used to sign the IPA.
- [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice) is used to install the IPA on the device.

- [Sideloader](https://github.com/Dadoum/Sideloader) has been heavily used as a reference for the implementation of the Apple Developer APIs and sideloading process.
